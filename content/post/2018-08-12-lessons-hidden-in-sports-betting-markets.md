With sports betting now legal in several US states, I might as well give away my number one piece of advice for amatuers looking to gamble:  

Don't bet.

It's an easy recommendation. Numbers implied by betting markets are too good, too close to the truth that, when accounting for the vig, it's nearly impossible to make a long term profit. 

But just because your local statistician tells you not to bet doesn't mean you shouldn't check out betting market odds. In fact, it's just the opposite. There's no single piece of public information that is more accurate and informative with respect to a professional sports game than the closing odds.  Related: there no better standard with which sports scientists can compare prediction models than to compare to betting odds. 

In a recent paper, [Ben](http://www.science.smith.edu/~bbaumer/w/), [Greg](https://statsinthewild.com/), and I took a deep dive to learn about what betting odds tell us about the four major North American pro sports leagues, the NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLB (sorry, MLS, but three-way odds are a different story). It's titled "How often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding randomness in North American sport," but our alternate title might as well be "Betting markets: if you can't beat em, use them in a statistical model." I'd welcome readers to check out a pre-print of the [manuscipt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05976), forthcoming in [Annals of Applied Statistics](https://www.imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-applied-statistics/), if they are interested in more details. As the paper's focus more on the technical side, what's missing is a cohesive summary of what it all means. In other words, how can we use our results -- built using betting market data -- to make better decisions in sports? 

I'll provide several ideas in the following set of posts.

- Part I: Randomness of regular season competition

- Part II: Randomness of postseason competition

- Part III: The benefit of playing at home

- Part IV: On schedule strength (or why the Orioles should have traded Manny Machado to the Dodgers for a spot in the NL West)
