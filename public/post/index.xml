      <description>One of the more reliable indicators of which NHL team is likely to get the next power play has little to do with score or style of play. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s been shown repeatedly (Ex 1, Ex 2) that referees call a substantially higher number of make-up penalties than would otherwise be expected in order to maintain an overall even number of violations on each team. Call it a $biased$ $impartiality$ &amp;ndash; in order to appear impartial by game&amp;rsquo;s end, ref&amp;rsquo;s let previous decisions drive future ones.</description>

Despite an initial pause, Chicago’s Kyle Schwarber ran in and attempted to field the ball around his knees.
 Ruled an error on Schwarber, the play gave the a Nationals run in an eventual 9-4 win.</description>
