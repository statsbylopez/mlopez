<p>In the 2016-17 regular season, the Washington Capitals <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2017/02/09/this-is-the-most-dominating-washington-capitals-team-ever-so-whats-it-mean-for-the-cup/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.940cf4c44b8f" target="_blank">dominated</a> the NHL like few teams in recent history, winning the President&rsquo;s Trophy with 118 points.</p>

<p>The Caps entered a second round playoff series with Pittsburgh as decent-sized favorites (58 percent), and sure enough, Washington outplayed its rivals. In each of seven consecutive games, the Capitals outshot the Penguins, finshing with 70 total more shots on goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Washington, not enough shots turned into goals, and because hockey games are decided by goals, it was the Penguins that moved onto the Eastern Conference Finals. The Caps were sent home, and the early exit was enough to drive NBC commentator Mike Milbury to the brink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have to rethink their whole philosophy,&rdquo; Milbury <a href="https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez/status/862503623565205504" target="_blank">opined</a> after the game.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to tell you what happened next. The Caps made a few changes to their roster in the ensuing offseason &ndash; call it a reconsidered philosophy &ndash; enough so that by this year&rsquo;s second round, they were the <a href="https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez/status/990611488401510401" target="_blank">least likely</a> team among the eight remaining to raise a Stanley Cup. Despite those odds, Washington won its first title.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Capitals team doesn’t have better talent than years past but they have better focus and attitudes,&rdquo; Milbury argued.</p>

<p>Washington&rsquo;s rise to the top of the NHL illustrates that, in hockey&rsquo;s postseason, surprising things can happen. In the rest of this post, I opine on what should and shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising in playoff competition, using the NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB.</p>

<h2 id="when-does-the-better-team-win-in-the-postseason">When does the better team win in the postseason?</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick trivia question.</p>

<p><strong>Two NBA playoff teams from the last decade are drawn at random and play one another in a &ldquo;best-of-7&rdquo; series &ndash; what is the probability that the better team wins out?</strong></p>

<p>Turns out, it&rsquo;s about 80%. In other words, the best NBA team advances, on average, in roughly four of five series.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty high number &ndash; how does it compare to other sports?</p>

<p>Given what we&rsquo;ve learned in previous posts about the randomness of games, it&rsquo;s no shock to find out that both the NHL and MLB hover just above 60% in &ldquo;best-of-7&rdquo; formats, which is notably lower. However, let&rsquo;s switch that question just a bit:</p>

<p><strong>How long would postseason series need to be in NFL, MLB and NHL to match the NBA&rsquo;s &ldquo;better team wins&rdquo; rate of 80%?</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05976" target="_blank">Ben, Greg, and I found</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the NFL, where the levels of competitiveness are fairly similar to the NBA, a &ldquo;best-of-11&rdquo; series would be needed to roughly yield a similar better team wins rate.</p></li>

<li><p>In the NHL, where the levels of competitiveness are more akin to coin tosses than NBA games, a &ldquo;best-of-51&rdquo; series would be needed to roughly yield a similar better team wins rate.</p></li>

<li><p>And in MLB, where levels of competitiveness are also more akin to coin tosses than NBA games, an astounding &ldquo;best-of-75&rdquo; series would be needed to roughly yield a similar better team wins rate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is, if we really want to compare postseason formats across sports (which we inherently do when we do things like count rings for individual players), we&rsquo;d need the NHL and MLB to do a complete, and obviously ludicrous, overhaul.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-compare-one-postseason-format-to-another">How can we compare one postseason format to another?</h2>

<p>The NFL&rsquo;s never going to use a &ldquo;best-of-7&rdquo; format, nor is MLB going to use a &ldquo;best-of-75&rdquo; format.</p>

<p>Instead, to better contrast each league, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05976" target="_blank">Greg, Ben and I</a> derived a general metric that takes existing postseason formats (number of teams, rounds, games in each round, etc), mixes in our measurements of team strength, and derives how closely each league aligns with a completely deterministic model where the best team <em>always</em> advanced.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a plot that summarizes the equivalence of current postseason formats in each of the MLB, NFL, NHL, and NBA. Tournaments where the better team always advanced would score on the far right, while tournaments where every competitor has an equal chance in each round would show up on the far left.</p>

<p><img src="/post/2018-08-22-part-i-randomness-of-regular-season-competition_files/parity.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the NBA stands out.* Interestingly, the NHL, MLB, and NFL all somewhat overlap. In other words, each league&rsquo;s postseason structure roughly does a similar job of allowing better teams to advance.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-this-all-mean">So what&rsquo;s this all mean?</h2>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s where the list gets long.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The best team doesn&rsquo;t always win in the postseason in any sport. However, the best team is substantially more likely to win in the NBA than in any of the other three leagues.</p></li>

<li><p>Compared to our <a href="http://statsbylopez.netlify.com/post/part-i-randomness-of-games/" target="_blank">regular season findings</a>, the better NFL teams advance less often in the postseason than perhaps we would have otherwise expected. However, there&rsquo;s an easy explanation &ndash; the league&rsquo;s single elimination format. Single elimination tournaments add noise &ndash; it&rsquo;s why the NCAA tournament is called March Madness, after all &ndash; which decrease the chances that the best team wins. It&rsquo;s why we have champs like the 2001 Patriots (not as good as the 2001 Rams) and the 2007 Giants (not as good as the 2007 Patriots). So, we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised when NFL teams that seem like surprises win out. That&rsquo;s what happens in single elimination formats.</p></li>

<li><p>While we&rsquo;re on the NFL, another subtle difference: it&rsquo;s the only league where a team is generally not given home advantage in the title game/series. This matters. The 2007 Patriots lost to the Giants on a neutral field in a one-game playoff series. Imagine the 2018 Warriors playing the Cavs for an NBA title in a one-game series in, say, Indianapolis? Yes, that&rsquo;d be incredible theater. But it&rsquo;d be incredible theater for the same reason that March Madness games are often incredible theater. The Warriors would be favored, but the Cavs&rsquo; chances in such a set-up would increase by several orders of magnitude, relative to the current NBA format.</p></li>

<li><p>From a team&rsquo;s standpoint, understanding the inherent randomness of postseason outcomes is critical. Some examples:</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Last seed into the NHL, NFL, or MLB playoffs? You still have a chance. It&rsquo;s worth playing hard for. It&rsquo;s worth bringing rested players back for. It&rsquo;s worth trade deadline moves to prepare for. It&rsquo;s worth everything for, because, in all likelihood, having the worst chance in the NHL/NFL/MLB playoffs is still actually a reasonable chance. Meanwhile, last seed in the NBA playoffs? Get your golf clubs ready.</p></li>

<li><p>Win an NFL, NHL, or MLB title? Congrats! Now check if you are one of the best teams. If you are, even better. But if you aren&rsquo;t the best team &ndash; say, you are the 2013 Red Sox, which won after <a href="https://statsbylopez.github.io/NESSIS2017_files/NESSIS_2017.html#how-often-does-the-best-team-win" target="_blank">getting every break in the book</a> against a more talented Tigers team &ndash; don&rsquo;t simply bring back all of your players and think that lightning will strike twice. It usually doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; the 2014 Red Sox, with largely the same pieces as in 2013, finished in last place in the American League East.</p></li>

<li><p>Fail to win an NFL, NHL, or MLB title? Here&rsquo;s where an understanding of the nature of postseason tournaments is most critical. If you are one of the top teams, do your best to keep going. Convince folks internally how talented and skilled your team actually was. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to use betting market ratings to back-up your argument. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to point out things like randomness and luck. And don&rsquo;t do things like &ldquo;rethink your whole philosophy&rdquo;. Though, in fairness, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do things that Mike Milbury says to do&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t need so much math.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider and support proposals to tweak league playoff formats. The NBA begins its playoffs with a &ldquo;best-of-7&rdquo; series between a No. 1 seed and a No. 8 seed. Sweeps in these matchups are often more likely than <em>any</em> wins from the No. 8 seed. Meanwhile, MLB starts with a one-game play-in game and a &ldquo;best-of-5&rdquo; series between a No. 1 seed and a No. 4 seed. In some years, MLBs No. 4 seed may have only be one or two regular season wins shy of the No. 1 seed. This set-up is markedly inequitable. MLB and NHL postseason formats don&rsquo;t do enough to reward good teams. Arguably, the NBA does too much to reward good teams.**</p></li>

<li><p>Stop the insane, overbearing, frustrating, and unfair allocation of credit and skill to teams that win titles and to teams that win titles alone. This is particularly biting in the NFL, MLB, and NHL, where a fumble recovery, third strike call, or crossbar can make a difference between winning a ring and not winning one.</p></li>

<li><p>Conversely, labeling once-in-a-generation players as chokers isn&rsquo;t quite appropriate in sports where it&rsquo;s tougher to win in the postseason, as <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/10-biggest-chokers-in-sports-history-108696/alexander-ovechkin-109184/" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a> did in 2017 with Alex Ovechkin.</p></li>

<li><p>Beware of the snake oil when it comes to postseason predictions. If it seems to good to be true, it probably is. As a hypothetical example of this, if a company says it can predict MLB or NHL series outcomes with 85-percent accuracy, perhaps avoid hiring that company to be the official sponsor of your league&rsquo;s stats page.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This post was long, but the varying formats and differing levels of league skill make postseason tournament outcomes in the MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL complex to contrast. For teams, coaches, players, and fans, understanding the operating characteristics of each league can go a long way towards ensuring the better decisions are made.</p>

<p><em>Footnotes</em></p>

<p>*We likely underestimate the deterministic nature of the NBA in this article. To derive team strengths, we used regular season data. However, stars play a more dominant role in the NBAs postseason play, which means we are likely underestimating how good certain teams have been (e.g, Golden State).</p>

<p>**The NFL is perfect and that is an unbiased opinion.</p>
