      <description>With sports betting now legal in several US states, I might as well give away my number one piece of advice for amatuers looking to gamble:
Don&amp;rsquo;t bet.
It&amp;rsquo;s an easy recommendation. Numbers implied by betting markets are too good, too close to the truth that, when accounting for the vig, it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible to make a long term profit.
But just because your local statistician tells you not to bet doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t check out betting market odds.</description>

      <description>One of the most humbling aspects of being a sports fan is that the better team doesn&amp;rsquo;t always win.
It could happen for a few reasons. The better team might get unlucky, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a missed foul call or bad bounce. The better team might play poorly, missing open three-pointers, field goals, or easy saves. Or the &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; team might simply be so close in terms of talent to the &amp;ldquo;worse&amp;rdquo; team that any number of plays, shots, or referee decisions could play into the game&amp;rsquo;s outcome, actions that, by and large, are largely noise and not indicative of any particular skill or talent.</description>

      <description>Baseball games are too slow, too long, so damned long, and, like my seven-year old daughter getting dressed in the morning, taking forever.
Despite the headlines, there’s one aspect of the game that has actually worked to speed the game up: how umpires call balls and strikes. As one piece of evidence, Brian and I found that, in the bottom half of extra innings, calls tend to favor whichever team is closer to winning.</description>

      <description>To err is to human In the third inning during a contest a few weeks back between the Nationals and Cubs, Washington’s Brian Goodwin hit a line drive to left field with two outs and a runner on third. Despite an initial pause, Chicago’s Kyle Schwarber ran in and attempted to field the ball around his knees.
 Ruled an error on Schwarber, the play gave the a Nationals run in an eventual 9-4 win.</description>
