      <description>With sports betting now legal in several US states, I might as well give away my number one piece of advice for amatuers looking to gamble:
Don&amp;rsquo;t bet.
It&amp;rsquo;s an easy recommendation. Numbers implied by betting markets are too good, too close to the truth that, when accounting for the vig, it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible to make a long term profit.
But just because your local statistician tells you not to bet doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t check out betting market odds.</description>

      <description>One of the most humbling aspects of being a sports fan is that the better team doesn&amp;rsquo;t always win.
It could happen for a few reasons. The better team might get unlucky, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a missed foul call or bad bounce. The better team might play poorly, missing open three-pointers, field goals, or easy saves. Or the &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; team might simply be so close in terms of talent to the &amp;ldquo;worse&amp;rdquo; team that any number of plays, shots, or referee decisions could play into the game&amp;rsquo;s outcome, actions that, by and large, are largely noise and not indicative of any particular skill or talent.</description>
