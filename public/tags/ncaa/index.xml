      <description>In 2014, Greg and I won the first annual Kaggle March Madness contest. This led to really cool things happening to a pair of nondescript statisticians that, to the likely detriment of our social lives, happened to know where to find good basketball data while also remembering, on a tight deadline, to enter type = &amp;quot;response&amp;quot; in our glm code.
The Kaggle victory was simultaneously awesome – like New York Times awesome – and embarassing, as Greg and I realized how lucky we were to have finished on top.</description>
